Interiors is an interactive generative fold-up house inspired 
by Hammershøi’s Interior from the Home of the Artist (1900), 
and by the themes of ‘home’ and ‘story’ that are activated by 
the painting’s subject and mood.

Interiors is a pattern for a fold-up house of many rooms and doors. 
It’s an instruction for the assemblage of the interior skin of Hammershøi’s house. 

Like a sewing pattern or an architectural plan, at full view its structure is evident: 
12 rooms, each inhabited by furniture objects that shuffle around the house in constant 
rearrangement, most rooms connected by doors, the resultant utility of pathway highlighted in blue trails. 

The first three rooms are representations of the elements described in Hammershøi’s Interior from the Home of the Artist (1900). 
The other 9 rooms are left to chance in the script.

Through simple commands (mouse click and mouse pan) the rooms can be explored at a claustrophobic zoom. 
Like the intricate IKEA furniture construction sheet, laying it all out there unfolded. 
Like the IKEA floor plan experience, seeking to drag the viewer through a labyrinthine path of fake living rooms and repeating modules.

House and story are useful creative metaphors for thinking about gen art fundamentals 
such as disclosure (how much of the system is intentionally revealed to the viewer), 
complexity / memory (how many characters, how many possibilities, 
how many russian dolls’ deep of endless containers of rules we cram into the algorithm), 
and categorisation (the stretch between epitome or edge), 
how to structure the sequenced machinery of the generative work (through cause and effect and audience interactivity), 
and where to tighten or release the grip of control on its retelling.
